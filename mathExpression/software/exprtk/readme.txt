C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit Library

[INTRODUCTION]
The C++ Mathematical Expression Library  (ExprTk) is a simple to  use,
easy  to  integrate and  extremely  efficient mathematical  expression
parsing and  evaluation engine.  The parsing  engine supports  various
kinds of  functional, logic  processing semantics  and is  very easily
extendible.
