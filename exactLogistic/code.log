You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted 
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see 
http://support.sas.com/rnd/migration/planning/platform/64bit.html

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is 
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any 
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see

This message is contained in the SAS news file, and is presented upon
initialization.  Edit the file "news" in the "misc/base" directory to
display site-specific news and information in the program log.
The command line option "-nonews" will prevent this display.

NOTE: 202 records were read from the infile "inputXY".
      The minimum record length was 5.
      The maximum record length was 5.
NOTE: The data set WORK.EXAMPLE has 202 observations and 3 variables.

NOTE: PROC LOGISTIC is modeling the probability that Y=0. One way to change this to model the probability that Y=1 is to specify 
      the response variable option EVENT='1'.
