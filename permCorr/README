using permutation to calculate the correlation between vector X and Y

main.c: 
algorithm 1: plain calculation
algorithm 2: involve some optimization
algorithm 3: base on alggorithm 2, using MKL library

speed: algorithm 1 is slowest, algorithm 2 is 10% faster, algorithm 3 is 10% faster.

pyCtypes.py:
using ctypes module to call C functions, speed is comparable to native C program.

perm_corr.py:
using numpy, speed is magnitude slower (< 10x) than C.

perm_corr.lua:
using LuaJIT 2.0.0-beta 5. about 2x faster than the speed of Python, however, 
it is still slower than C.
